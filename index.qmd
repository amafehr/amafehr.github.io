I am a second year [Complex Systems Ph.D.](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/interdisciplinary-programs) student
at the University of Vermont in Burlington. I'm a member of the [Computational Story Lab](https://compstorylab.org/)
at the [Vermont Complex Systems Center](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/).

My main, broad interest is people in [complex systems](https://complexityexplained.github.io/).


<i>Expected graduation date of summer 2028.</i>

## Research Interests
I am interested in measuring complex, interpersonal processes in digital mediums.
People are motivated to socially connect and often rely on technology and text to do so,
leading me in the direction of asking how well technology facilitates this goal and how
can we best measure the constructs driving this process in individual and collective levels?

## Personal Interests
* Biking
* Science fiction and fantasy reading
* Board games and social video gaming
* Baking
