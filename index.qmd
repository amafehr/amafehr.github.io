I am a second year [Complex Systems Ph.D.](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/interdisciplinary-programs)
student in the [Computational Story Lab](https://compstorylab.org/) at the
[Vermont Complex Systems Center at the University of Vermont (UVM)](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/) in Burlington, Vermont.
<!-- My research has mostly focused on network science applied to biology.
This led me in the direction of mathematical methods for networks, specifically
stochastic models that involve branching processes. -->

Expected graduation date summer 2028.

## Research Interests
* I am interested in the measuring the complex, interpersonal processes at play in digital conversation. How well does technology facilitate and how can we best measure the constructs driving this process in individual and collective levels?


## Personal Interests
* Biking
* Science fiction and fantasy reading
* Board games and social video gaming
* Baking
