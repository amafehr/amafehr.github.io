People are motivated to socially connect and often rely on technology and text to do so, leading me in the direction of asking how well technology facilitates this goal and how can we best measure the constructs driving this process in individual and collective levels?"

    "text": "Before joining the program, I worked in various roles as a research, applied, or data scientist. I applied my prior education in psychology to more applied behavioral science questions, conducting work ranging from survey data collection to representing people in simulations using agent based modeling. Over this professional experience, I became more interested in how we can study and evaluate systems involving people, leading me to find the area of complexity science!\n\nI am otherwise engaged in walking my dogs, planning my next cabin or bike trip, or getting a board game group together. And I might bake something to bring along."
