title: "About"

Before joining the program, I worked in various roles as a research, applied, or data scientist.
I applied my prior BA and MS education in psychology to applied behavioral science questions,
conducting work ranging from survey data collection to representing people in simulations
using agent based modeling. Over this professional experience, I became more interested in how
we can study and evaluate systems involving people, leading me to the area of complexity science!


I am otherwise engaged in walking my dogs, planning my next cabin or bike trip, or having a game night.
