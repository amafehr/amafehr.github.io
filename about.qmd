Before joining the program, I worked in various roles as a research, applied, or data scientist.
I applied my prior education in psychology to more applied behavioral science questions,
conducting work ranging from survey data collection to representing people in simulations
using agent based modeling. Over this professional experience, I became more interested in how
we can study and evaluate systems involving people, leading me to find the area of complexity science!

I am otherwise engaged in walking my dogs, planning my next cabin or bike trip, or getting a
board game group together. And I might bake something to bring along.
